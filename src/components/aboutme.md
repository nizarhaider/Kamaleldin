Hey there! I'm a digital product designer and developer, rocking a solid three years of freelance wizardry, and couple more of startup work experience. **My coding adventures** kicked off during my IGCSE ICT class when I got cozy with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then, I took the wild road to a Software Engineering degree at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia.

Now, let's talk about **my artsy side** – that's been brewing since I first laid eyes on a sketchbook at the ripe age of 10. From there, I dabbled in all sorts of creative shenanigans, including sculpting, architectural planning on AutoCAD and SketchUp, playing director with videography, and even moonlighting as a graphic guru. 
But my true calling? **Product design**, where I finally fused my design obsession with my software sorcery!
