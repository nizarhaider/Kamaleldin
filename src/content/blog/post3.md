## Challenges

1. **Audience Alignment**: Tavern Dao's existing design lacked resonance with its tech-savvy gamer audience, necessitating a fresh design approach to captivate and engage users effectively.

2. **Fragmented Design**: The absence of a design system led to inconsistency in user interface elements and compromised the overall user experience.

3. **Scholarships page Enhancement**: The Scholarships feature, a cornerstone of Tavern Dao's offering, required an elevated design to provide a seamless and engaging experience, while providing options for the more hardcore users.


## Solutions

1. **User-Centric Aestheticsn**: Focusing on user preferences and gaming culture, I developed a design that resonated with Tavern Dao's target audience, blending modern aesthetics and gamification elements.

2. **Holistic Design System**: I meticulously crafted a comprehensive design system encompassing standardized UI components, typography, color schemes, and interaction guidelines. This design system facilitated a consistent and cohesive user experience across Tavern Dao's ecosystem.

3. **Scholarships Redesign**: Through iterative design and usability research, I revitalized the Scholarships feature webpage with a high-fidelity design. Enhanced visuals, intuitive navigation, and seamless interactions were integrated to ensure a captivating user journey. In addition, the scholarships list provides an option for a tabular view for the hardcore users.
