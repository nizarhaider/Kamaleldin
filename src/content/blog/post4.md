### Market Research

Studied competitors' maintenance management systems to identify best practices and design trends in the industry. The result of this research concluded that there yet to be clear user experience design best practices in this industry yet. In addition, the competitors in the market still cary on with outdated designs of user interfaces. However, there seem to be a trends starting to form with the use of Modals as they have proven to improve the users experience.
